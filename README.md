# try_luck
Guess the Number game in three attempts.

How It Works:

The program picks a random number from 1 to 10.

The user gets 3 chances to guess it.

After each guess, the user is told if the guess is too high or too low.

If they guess correctly, the game congratulates them and ends early.

If they fail in 3 tries, the correct number is revealed.
